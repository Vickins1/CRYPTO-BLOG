1️⃣ Start Hardhat Console
npx hardhat console --network localhost

2️⃣ Import Ethers
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

3️⃣ Get the Signers (Your Wallet Address)
const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
console.log("Deployer Address:", deployer.address);

4️⃣ Attach to Your Deployed Contract
Make sure to replace the contract address with the actual deployed contract address:
const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("KEVOH", "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512");
console.log("Contract Attached at:", contract.target);

5️⃣ Get Deployer’s Token Balance (Fix ReferenceError)
let balance = await contract.balanceOf(deployer.address);
console.log("Deployer's Token Balance:", ethers.formatUnits(balance, 18));
